# Sudoku_Solver
Program that solves sudokus, comes with few examples and one of the worlds most difficult sudoku

The unsolved sudoku is defined at the beginning as a matrix. 
I included 4 sudoku examples, the last one is the famous Arto Inkala sudoku.

Once the sudoku is defined, make the program executable (chmod +x sudoku_v4.py) and run it from command line simply by ./sudoku_v4.py 

Have fun!
