# Sudoku_Solver
Program that solves sudokus, comes with few examples and one of the worlds most difficult sudoku

The unsolved sudoku is defined at the beginning as a matrix. 
I included 4 sudoku examples, the last one is the famous Arto Inkala sudoku.

Once the sudoku is defined, the programm can be run from command line simply by ./sudoku.v4

Have fun!
